Unemployment Analysis in India:
This project analyzes the unemployment trends in India using publicly available data.
The goal is to understand overall patterns, the impact of Covid-19, seasonal variations, and regional differences.

Features:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Overall unemployment trend analysis
3. Covid-19 impact on unemployment
4. Seasonal and monthly patterns
5. Regional/state-level unemployment comparison
6.Actionable insights for policymakers

Project Structure:
Notebook/Script – Main Colab notebook containing analysis steps
Dataset – Unemployment in India (from Kaggle)
Visualizations – Line plots, boxplots, and regional comparisons

Results & Insights:
1. Before Covid, average unemployment was around 9.4%, which rose to ~15% during Covid-19.

3. Regional analysis shows unemployment was not uniform across states.
4. Policymakers could focus job schemes in states & months with the highest unemployment.

Tech Stack:
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib, Seaborn

Future Work:
1. Add predictive modeling to forecast unemployment trends
2. Compare with GDP and inflation data
3.Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or PowerBI
